# AMPs-script
description function of AMPs project script:

input_format.pl -> trun sequence data as number data;

main_function.py -> main function for train model;

orf_predict.py -> predict ORF sequences in metagenome;

prediction.py -> using train model to predict AMPs from the datasets was translation by orf_predict.py;

self_defined_Metrics.py -> this script using to change lr and calculate parameters;

list to do next:

a. need a script to re-format relust file by blastp predition AMPs with already known AMPs, to remove redundancy sequence data.

b. a script to calculate the relative abundence of specific AMP in whole metagenome.
